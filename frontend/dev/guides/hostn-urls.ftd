-- ds.page:

for amitu.com, we will have following:
amitu_site = Site(domain="amitu.com", org=amitu)
Domain(domain="amitu.com", site=amitu_site)
Domain(domain="www.amitu.com", site=amitu_site)
For every site we will have a fifthtry-sites.com sub-domain
Domain(domain="amitucom.fifthtry-sites.com", site=amitu_site)
amitucom will be called the "site-slug for a site"
from `hostn server` perspective, if a request comes to any domain other
than amitu_site.domain, we will redirect to amitu_site.domain.
The site admin url for amitu.com would be www.fifthtry.com/amitu.com/.
The editor etc urls would be www.fifthtry.com/amitu.com/editor/
so for a free site,
rithik_site = Site(domain="rithik-site", org=amitu)
without custom domain mapped it would be:
a. fifthtry.com/rithik-site/ or
b. fifthtry.com/rithik-site.fifthtry-sites.com/

We will go with b because it is shorter to type.

We will use `.` to decide if a domain is a custom domain or a site-slug.

If a request to fifthtry.com/amitucom/, we will redirect to
fifthtry.com/amitu.com/

Further we will redirect amitu.com/-/admin/ to fifthtry.com/amitu.com/
