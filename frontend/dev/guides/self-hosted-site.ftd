-- ds.h1: How Is A Site Created?

Someone will have to setup a linux server, and install fastn on it, and create the fastn package.
They will have to setup at least one authentication mechanism in FASTN.ftd. The admin will have
to also map the domain name and manage the SSL certificates etc.

-- ds.h1: API

All future operations will happen over the `login`, `clone` and `sync` APIs. The API endpoint would be
the package name of the site itself. If domain or SSL certificate expires or is misconfigured, the API
will not be available.
