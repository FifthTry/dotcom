-- ds.page: UI and Pages

All UI that powers FifthTry.com is defined in `ui.fifthtry.com` package (`ui` in short).
The `ui` contains "pages".

`ui` internally contains more than just pages, but we should assume only the "pages" are
as part of the public API.

-- ds.h1: What is a Page?

A page is the thing that is loaded in the browser, and covers the entire window. Pages
are technically fastn components, but they are special components, in that they are the
top level components. The pages must always be `ftd.document` components.
