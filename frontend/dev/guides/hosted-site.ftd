-- ds.h1: How Does Auth Work With Hosted Sites?

Hosted sites are created by someone how is logged in on FifthTry first. This is unavoidable.

All FifthTry sites would have FifthTry OAuth enabled, so anyone with a FifthTry account can
log in to any FifthTry site. In most case the owner will have opt in feature, or other ways to
limit who can log in, most websites may not want any FifthTry owner to be able to login and
do stuff on their site. So they may ask for permission (and owner has to approve each user)
or the owner may set some rules (like only users with a certain email domain can log in).

The site owner can also chose to activate other OAuth providers, like Google, Facebook, etc.

-- ds.h1: How Is A Site Created

-- ds.h2: Web UI

The normal way to create a website is via the web UI. You can go to `fifthtry.com` and click
on `Create Site` button. You will be asked to login, and then you will be asked to choose a
template. Once you choose a template, you will be asked to choose other meta data like
domain name, payment plan (which decides the amount of resources you get), etc.

-- ds.h2: CLI

You can also create a site using `fastn create-site` command. This command will ask you
if you want to host your site using FifthTry, in which case it will ask you to login
to FifthTry and call the `create-site` API endpoint.

The `create-site` API endpoint will return a URL to which you can send the user to to
configure the meta data for the site. The CLI will keep polling to see if site creation
step is over.

We will also give CLI flags to pass all the meta data, so that you can create a site without
having to go through the web UI.

-- ds.h1: API

API endpoint for any hosted site would always be `api.fifthtry.com`.

-- ds.h1: What Happens When A Site Is Created

When a site is created, we store the meta data in the `sites` table. We will then communicate
with the hostn service.
