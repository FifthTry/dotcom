-- ds.page: CLI Auth

Some of the fastn packages would be hosted by fifthtry, and some would be self-hosted. In case
of self hosted, each site is unique, and we need to authenticate with each site. In case of FifthTry
hosted sites, we can use the same authentication for all sites.

How do we know if any given package is hosted by FifthTry or not? In `.fastn/config.json` we have:

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd
body: <BODY

-- record config:
string api-end-point: https://fifthtry.com/api
;; self hosted sites, or sites using custom oath providers will store credentials in this file
;; fifthtry hosted sites will use the credentials stored in ~/.fastn/config.json
optional credentials:

BODY>


-- end: ds.page
