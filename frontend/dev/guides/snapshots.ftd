-- ds.page: Snapshot

We have to store snapshot of every slide, so we do not have to keep on rendering
`ftd` files all the time.

-- ds.h1: Storage

In future we will store the snapshot in S3 or some such store. For making it
easy to develop, we are storing it in database itself.

-- ds.h2: Database Store

We store the image in `slides_slide_snapshot` table. This table contains two
columns, `preview` and `thumbnail`. In both columns we store the image
content as PNG.

In the `preview` column we store the full size image. The full size depends on
the slide preset.

In the `thumbnail` column we store the image of size 400x300 (??).

-- ds.h2: Serving Image

Even when we store the image in S3, we probably want to serve it via
fastn/django because we want to guarantee that image is not readable by anyone
other than those who have access to it. One way to do that is to make image URL
hard to guess by using some kind of hash.

TBD: If we should really also serve images via django in prod when we have S3
implementation.

For serving image we use the [`serve-image API`](/dev/apis/serve-image/).

-- ds.h1: Creating Snapshots

We will use two phase save process to save a slide.
