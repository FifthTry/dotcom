-- ds.page: Templates

We have presentation templates, which can be used to create presentations.

-- ds.h1: How Are Templates Created?

All presentations are created from another template. Each template has one or
more slide-templates. Once a presentation is created from a
presentation-template, all the slide-templates belonging to that
presentation-template are copied into the presentation.

-- ds.h1: Team Templates

Each team can curate a bunch of "team templates", they are stored in TeamTemplate
table, and only "managers" of a team can manage team templates.

-- ds.h1: Public Template

Any template can be made public, and then it will be available to all users.

-- ds.h1: Featured Templates

Any template can be made featured, and then it will be available to all users, and shown in featured
templates list.

-- ds.h1: Template Marketplace

In future we can make templates paid, if you try to use a paid template, you
will have to pay for it.

-- ds.h1: Template Meta Data

Along with owner, public (boolean), featured (boolean), and payment (optional
$value, in future), each template has a `title`, and `description`.

Beyond this, any template can have any number of custom fields.

When a template is added to team, the custom fields are updated.
