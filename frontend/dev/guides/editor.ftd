-- ds.page: Editor

-- ds.h1: Preview Pane

-- ds.h2: Preview Pane Shows Unsaved Changes

If any file is changed, we will do a post request to the server, with the content of the
file, and the server will return the rendered page. The preview pane will show the rendered
page.

If there are multiple files changed but not saved, editor will send the content of all the
files, and the server will render the page.

-- ds.h2: Live Preview

We will reload the page in the preview pane, when the content of any editor tab changes.

This will have a corresponding toggle UI, which can be used to disable this feature, say
if we are working with a heavy page, or a page with a form.


-- ds.h2: Minimise Preview Pane

There would be a minimize button in the editor pane, which will hide it, and show a floating
maximize button, similar to the dark mode switcher we have currently, near the bottom right
corner of the screen.

-- ds.h2: Desktop | Mobile | Tablet

This set of buttons (or icons) will be used to switch between the different device sizes. The
preview pane size will change accordingly.

-- ds.h2: Full Screen Preview

This button will open the preview pane in full screen mode. Even mobile or tablet views can
open in full screen mode.

If we have a presentation in the ftd, full screen should be function as a presentation mode.

-- ds.h2: URL Display

In the page we should always see the relative URL (the portion starting from the `/` after the
domain name). This will be editable, and the page will be reloaded when the URL is changed.

-- ds.h2: Open In Live

From the preview we should be able to view the live version of the site. We should have both
open live, and copy live url functions there.

-- ds.h2: Follow Editor Toggle

When we switch from one file to next in the editor, the preview pane should follow the editor,
if the follow editor toggle is on. This toggle should be on by default. This toggle should is
needed for scenarios like if you are editing a component in say `lib.ftd`, but the component
is never called from `lib.ftd`, only from `index.ftd`, so I will navigate to `/` in the preview
pane, and click off the follow editor toggle, so that the preview pane does not follow, and
then switch back to `lib.ftd` in the editor, and start editing the component.

Follow should also do the reverse, if follow toggle is on, and I click on a link in the preview
pane, and the next page is part of current site, the editor should open the corresponding file.

-- ds.h2: Page Variable View

From the preview pane, we should be able to view the page variables.

-- ds.h1: Logs Pane

Along with preview pane, we should have a logs pane, which will show the logs from the server,
when rendering any page in the preview pane.
