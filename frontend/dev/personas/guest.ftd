-- ds.page: Guest

Guests are not added to the team, but can be invited to collaborate on a presentation, and for that presentation
they will have the access granted to them by the person who shared it.

Guests can not create presentation, only participate in existing ones.

Guests are also stored in TeamMember table for easy lookup.
